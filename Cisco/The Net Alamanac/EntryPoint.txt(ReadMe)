Well. So I've decided to write a guide to future Networking Members... hope it is usefull as this will be a collection of what I know
about networking and what resources you can use to further your knowledge, As time passes I will keep adding to this guide (until I 
no longer can).

Now, this document, or assembly of documents is NOT meant to teach you the full breath of the networking field, for it is large and vast
and my knowledge of it at this time is incomplete. BUT, it is meant to be an aid for what will, at first, be a hard task, but with 
practice and dedication will become much easier.

This Alamanac wil be ordered in various categories, of which they will hopefully be self explanatory, in any case it is advisable to read
or do them in order.

~~~A note to future members of the Networking Team~~~
Feel free to add and update this document, let it be a living document that grows with each member.
