Okay, well, If you are reading this file I am assuming you know nothing, or very little about the world of networking and
how it works. That is okay, the world you are about to enter is vast and complicated, filled with terms and acronyms that,
honestly, many times do not make sense. But, do not fear, for this "chapter" is intended to introduce the basic concepts that
will help you in the competition and in understanding the world of networking. The very first concept we will talk is one that is
pivotal to every computer in the world: binary.

Binary, (the ones and zeroes want the ring guys...)
Well, what is binary!?, such a strange word that I have not heard of before (insert confused laughing noises). Worry not, for the
concept is actually quite simple. One of the meanings of the word is "involving two". In the case of computer science, this word
refers to the base 2 numerical system computers use, the system of literal ones and zeroes the computer uses to interpret, store and 
process all the data it has. Without binary a computer would not even be a computer, since it uses binary for EVERYTHING, literally from 
the word you see on this screen to the music you hear can be represented as a long string(gotcha to those who know programming) of ones 
and zeroes. For example the word 'A' can be represented as: 01000001, the ones and zeroes you see there are the ASCII representation
of the letter 'A'. From the previous example the long string of zeroes and ones you see is binary, all it is a way is a bunch of zeroes
and ones that computers use to represent ANY data they have, take the binary out of a computer and you don't have a computer (unless you
are a 'Master Hacker'and make one that uses a different system, any takers for this idea?).

The 'system' of binary (The HEX of the BYTE is out to get me guys...)
Now, we finally know what the binary system is, HORAYYY!. That is just the beginning, it is now important to know how the system works,
and we will first start with it's classification:
  -One individual one or zero is called a 'bit'
  -Eigth 'bits' make one 'byte'
  -One thousand 'bites' make one kilobyte
  -One thousand 'kilobytes' make one 'Megabyte' 
  -One thousand 'Megabytes' makes one 'Gygabyte'
With this small table of binary 'classification' and our understanding of the system we can now start to look at it's applications
into the field of networking.
